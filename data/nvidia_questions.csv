"Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions,markets,
 or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change.Additionally,
 stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, whichcould cause
 us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. Asthe
 COVID-19  pandemic  continues,  the  timing  and  overall  demand  from  customers  and  the  availability  of  supply  chain,  logistical  services  andcomponent supply may have a material net negative imp
act on our business and financial results.The
 manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographiclocations,

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA  pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated
computing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.
Our two operating segments are ""Compute & Networking"" and ""Graphics."" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,
Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Demand and Supply , Product T ransitions, and New Products and Business Models
Demand for our data center systems and produc ts surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across
several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and
capacity purchases with existing suppliers, adde d new vendors and entered into prepaid manu facturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase
volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase
commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain
components. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains
very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or
impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
We build finished produc ts and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments,
we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These
risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain,
creating additional supply chain complexity .
Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simul taneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and
support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center ,
Professional Visualizatio n, and Gaming products . We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associat ed with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing
lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures","[""What are NVIDIA's two operating segments as mentioned in the text?""]"

driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through
license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a
custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.
Sales and Marketing
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient
computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and
various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device
manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, ISVs, internet and CSPs, automotive
manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and
solution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe
that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer
satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within
each platform.
To encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships
in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our
platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products
available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and
game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries
and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.
As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms, systems and
software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our products are also
sold direct to CSPs, enterprise customers, retail channels and consumers.
Seasonality
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers, professional workstations,
and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production
schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third
quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2023, our supply exceeded our demand in several areas, and our
revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.

Note 6 - Goodwill
We
 changed our reportable segments to ""Graphics"" and ""Compute & Networking"" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as discussed inNote
 17 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwillbalance
 to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there wasno
 goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion andthe
 amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. As ofJanuary
 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute &Networking
 reporting units was $347 million and $271 million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $3.57 billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill of$3.43
 billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $143 million from other acquisition activities, all of which were allocated to theCompute
 & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we completed our annual impairment testsand concluded that goodwi

Our supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current
supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand. At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and
prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply
commitments are misaligned with demand for our products.
Our demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently
negatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners
prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may
impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions
and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in
our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers
anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions.
While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are
difficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial
results may be negatively impacted.
We sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made
by our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products
have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates
provided by various downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase
production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers
may experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be
damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.
If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our
competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a
reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a
result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our","['What factors could impact the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, according to the text?']"

of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related
matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or
misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption
of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.
In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach
notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents
the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used
and shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data
breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, became operative in 2023, and restricts the use of certain categories of sensitive
personal information; further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands
the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose
administrative fines for noncompliance. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation which differ
from the CPRA and each become effective in 2023. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local
levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in
products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The
European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR,
governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively,
including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we
are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of
individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists
a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and
disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.
In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other
countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR
generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard
Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not

 of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based onour belief
 that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in thesematters cannot be reasonably estimat
ed at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of businessand,
 while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverseeffect on our operating results, liquidity or financial pos
ition.71","['What is the status of the legal proceedings against NVIDIA Corporation as of January 31, 2021?']"
"other softwa re tools to help deploy our technolog y in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of
startups through our Inception program. Additionally , our Deep Learning Institute provides instruc tion on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy
neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics.  We believe that comp uter graphics infused with AI is fundamental to the
continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer
entertainment and professional visualization applications and create new virtual world and simu lation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving
the gaming, design, and creative industries forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized experience on our GeForce and
NVIDIA  RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-end, from the developer tools and cloud services to the Tensor Cores included in all
RTX-class GPUs. For example, NVIDIA  Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, is a suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative
AI, running in the cloud or locally on the PC. GeForce Experience enhances each gamer ’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the
recording and sharing of gameplay . Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design
collaboration and virtual world simulation softwa re that empowers artists, designers, and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We
also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost
anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of autonomous vehicles, or AV, and electric vehicles, or EV, is revolutionizing
the transpor tation indust ry. The algorithms requi red for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-
coded appro aches and will use multiple neural networks instead. In addition, EV makers are looking for next-generation centralized car computers that integrate
a wide range of intelligent functions into a single AI compute platform. Therefore, we provide an AI-based hardware and software solution, designed and
implemented from the ground up based on automotive safety standards, for the AV and EV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market
through our partnerships with automotive OEMs,

"supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H800, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,
including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered
by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG
will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome
conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have
clear standards or an opportunity for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of
products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for
countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and already have disadvantaged and may in the future

"Table of Contents
The fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate includes the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses beginning
in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in a greater FDII deduction and significantly increased current taxes, with a corresponding deferred tax benefit
at the relevant statutory tax rate.
The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to increased tax benefits of the FDII
deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to lower profitability. This is partially offset by the impact
of an increase in the proportion of earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time benefits of the domestication of a foreign
subsidiary in fiscal year 2022, or the Domestication.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII
deduction, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the FDII deduction,
income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based
compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.

As of January 29, 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $7.91 billion from the end of
fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and
credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a decrease in net income
adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion, and higher tax payments, partially offset by
changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by lower accounts receivable due to strong collections partially
offset by timing of supplier payments and inventory deliveries.
Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by lower purchases and higher
sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by higher capital expenditures.

directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which
it relates.
Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments
As described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-
down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions
relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159
million and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a
significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions
for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by
management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing
assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing
procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for
excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future
demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for
excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing
the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions
related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions",['What procedures were performed to address the critical audit matter concerning the valuation of inventories in the consolidated financial statements?']

Management’s
 discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, whichhave
 been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States,  or U.S. GAAP.  The preparation  of thesefinancial
 statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue,expenses
 and  related  disclosure  of  contingencies.  On  an  on-going  basis,  we  evaluate  our  estimates,  including  those  related  to  businesscombinations,
 inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various otherassumptions
 that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying values of assets and liabilities.
We
 believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  affect  our  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidatedfinancial
 statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with theAudit
 Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  The  Audit  Committee  has  reviewed  our  disclosures  relating  to  our  critical  accounting  policies  andestimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Combinations
The
 application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumedand
 estimate  the  fair  value  of  each.  The  fair  value  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  acquisition  are  recognized  at  theacquisition
 date,  with  the  purchase  price  exceeding  the  fair  values  being  recognized  as  goodwill.  Determining  fair  value  of  identifiable  assets,particularly
 intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances,the
 allocations  of  the  purchase  price  are  based  upon  preliminary  estimates  and  assumptions  and  subject  to  revision  when  we  receive  finalinformation,
 including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when theinformation,
 or  the  facts  and  circumstances,  becomes  available,  but  will  not  exceed  twelve  months.  We  will  recognize  measurement-periodadjustments during the period of resolution, including the ef
fect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if theaccounting had been complete
d at the acquisition date.Goodwill
 and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value ofan
 acquired  intangible apart  from  goodwill whenever the intangible arises  from  contractual  or  other  legal rights,  or  when it can be separated  ordivided
 from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract,asset
 or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a businesscombination","['What technology is powering a range of electric vehicles from carmakers Saic, Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng?']"
"or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a businesscombination
 and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using acombination
 of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economicand
 market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgmentand
 are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the riskof the projects not achieving technologic
al feasibility.Inventories
Inventory
 cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge costof
 sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most ofour
 inventory  provisions  relate  to  excess  quantities  of  products  or  components,  based  on  our  inventory  levels  and  future  product  purchasecommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Situations
 that  may  result  in excess  or  obsolete  inventory  include changes in business  and economic  conditions,  changes  in market  conditions,sudden and significant decre
ases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements,failure to estimate customer demand properly, or

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide
reasonable assurance.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023
based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2023.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 29, 2023 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our
enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to
accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter of fiscal
year 2023, we completed the consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included updating our internal control over
financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
NVIDIA have been detected.
ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION
None.
ITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS
Not Applicable.
PART III 
Certain information required by Part III is omitted from this report because we will file with the SEC a definitive proxy statement pursuant to
Regulation 14A, or the 2023 Proxy Statement, no later than 120 days after the end of fiscal year 2023, and certain information included therein is

"(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually received or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate records will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
of shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Service Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisions of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commitment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance with applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option",['When will corporate action constituting a grant of an Award be deemed completed by the Company?']

 and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which mayalter
 partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inabilityto
 sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition andresults of operations.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.
To
 be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully,  we must attract,  retain and motivate our executives and key employees andrecruit
 and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive marketfor
 skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diversetalent.
 Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retainqualified
 employees.  If  we  are  less  successful  in  our  recruiting  efforts,  or  if  we  cannot  retain  key  employees,  our  business  may  be  adverselyaffected.
 Competition  for  personnel  results  in  increased  costs  in  the  form  of  cash  and  stock-based  compensation.  We  also  must  retain  the  keypersonnel
 hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent on theservices of our longstanding executiv
e team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involvingexecutives and key employees could h

We are working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-one suppliers, sensor manufacturers,
automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing
architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our Data Center computing solutions,  and then running a full perception, fusion, planning, and control
stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA  DRIVE Hyperion platform. DRIVE Hyperion consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing
hardware, a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular DRIVE software platform for autonomous driving, mapping,
and parking services, and intelligent in-vehicle experiences.
In addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA  DRIVE Sim, based on NVIDIA  Omniverse software, for digital cockpit
development, as well as for testing and validating a self-driving platform. Our unique end-t o-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous
innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.
Business Strategies
NVIDIA ’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA  accelerated computing platform.  Our accelerated computing platform can solve complex problems in significantly less time and with
lower power  consumption than alternative comp utational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to
deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’ s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, and software
layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,
which includ e Data Center , Gaming, Professio nal Visualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we
address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CUDA  and netw orking technologies as the fundamental building blocks. The
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research and development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end
markets with shared underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed eithe r internally or by third-party developers and partners. We utilize
this platform approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leade rship in AI. We provide  a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing platform for AI, addressing both training
and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and networking solutions across processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our
compute solutions include all three major processing units in AI servers – GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add
AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. In addition, we offer DGX Cloud, an AI-training-as-a-service platform, and
NeMo – a complete solution for building enterpr ise-ready Large Language Models, or LLMs, using open source and proprietary LLMs created by NVIDIA  and
third parties. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing platforms are available from
virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA  and our
other softwa re tools to help deploy our technolog y in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of","[""What is NVIDIA's unified AI computing architecture used for in the automotive industry?""]"

Global T rade
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong
Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.
In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other
regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.
We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,
including those for which  the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market
in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing
requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the
licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the
license application in a timely manner or at all.
Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in
the USG’s export contro ls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitic al tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the
export contr ol rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our
business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our invento ry of such products and may be unable to develop replacement
products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the
Middle East.
While we work to enhan ce the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export
controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors

to solve large and complex problems.
We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as consumer product
and service recommendations, to chatbots for the automation of or assistance with live customer interactions, to enabling fraud detection in
financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading consumer internet and cloud services
companies, enterprises and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across multiple industries. We partner with industry leaders
to help transform their applications or their computing platforms. We also have partnerships in transportation, retail, healthcare, and
manufacturing, among others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.
At the foundation of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform are our GPUs, which excel at parallel workloads such as the training and
inferencing of neural networks. They are available in industry standard servers from every major computer maker and CSP, as well as in our
DGX AI supercomputer, a purpose-built system for deep learning and GPU accelerated applications. To facilitate customer adoption, we have
also built other ready-to-use system reference designs around our GPUs, including HGX for hyperscale and supercomputing data centers, EGX
for enterprise and edge computing, IGX for high-precision edge AI, and AGX for autonomous machines.
In fiscal year 2023, we introduced the Hopper architecture of data center GPUs, and started shipping the first Hopper-based GPU – the flagship
H100. Hopper includes a Transformer Engine, designed to accelerate the training of AI transformer models by an order of magnitude over the
prior generation. H100 is ideal for accelerating applications such as large language models, deep recommender systems, genomics and
complex digital twins.
NVIDIA will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include
NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has
partnered with leading cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers.
Our networking solutions include InfiniBand and Ethernet network adapters and switches, related software, and cables. This has enabled us to
architect end-to-end data center-scale computing platforms that can interconnect thousands of compute nodes with high-performance
networking. While historically the server was the unit of computing, as AI and HPC workloads have become extremely large spanning thousands
of compute nodes, the data center has become the new unit of computing, with networking as an integral part.
Beyond GPUs, NVIDIA has expanded its data center processor portfolio to include DPUs, currently shipping in the market, and CPUs with
samples planned to ship in the first half of fiscal year 2024. The NVIDIA Bluefield DPU is supported by foundational data-center-infrastructure-
on-a-chip software, or DOCA, that lets developers build software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking, security, storage and management
applications for BlueField DPUs. Partners supporting Bluefield include many of the top security, storage and networking companies. We can
optimize across the entire computing, networking and storage stack to deliver data center-scale computing solutions. The Grace CPU is
designed for AI infrastructure and high-performance computing, providing the highest performance and twice the memory bandwidth and energy-
efficiency compared to today’s leading server chips.
While our approach starts with powerful chips, what makes it a full-stack computing platform is our large body of software, including the CUDA",['What is the purpose of the Transformer Engine in the Hopper architecture of data center GPUs introduced by NVIDIA in fiscal year 2023?']

learning super sampling, or NVIDIA DLSS, our AI technology that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games.
Our products for the gaming market include GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs for gaming desktop and laptop PCs, GeForce NOW cloud
gaming for playing PC games on underpowered devices, SHIELD for high quality streaming on TV, as well as system-on-chips (SOCs) and
development services for game consoles.
In fiscal year 2023, we introduced the GeForce RTX 40 Series of gaming GPUs, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The 40 Series features
our third generation RTX technology, third generation NVIDIA DLSS, and fourth generation Tensor Cores to deliver up to 4X the performance of
the previous generation.
Professional Visualization
We serve the Professional Visualization market by working closely with independent software vendors, or ISVs, to optimize their offerings for
NVIDIA GPUs. Our GPU computing platform enhances productivity and introduces new capabilities for critical workflows in many fields, such as
design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design, architectural design,
consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and
post-production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.
The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with physically accurate shadows,
reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and content creation applications developed by our ecosystem
partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs and software.
Digital images used in product design need to mirror reality. This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-
based rendering. NVIDIA Omniverse is a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows, such as building and operating
metaverse and 3D internet applications, available as a software subscription for enterprise use and free for individual use. Omniverse, virtual
reality, or VR, and augmented reality, or AR, are being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications. Virtual car showrooms,
surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy these technologies, powered by our GPUs.
Automotive
NVIDIA’s Automotive market is comprised of AV, AI cockpit, electric vehicle computing platforms, and infotainment platform solutions. Leveraging
our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for
the AV market under the DRIVE Hyperion brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as",['How does NVIDIA leverage GPUs and sophisticated software to enhance the gaming experience?']

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of
revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to
inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and
estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge
cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory,
and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based
on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which
requires management judgment.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic
conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of
changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes
in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the
impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of
customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.
The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of
7.5% in fiscal year 2023 and 0.9% in fiscal year 2022. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory
based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. In the
past, our manufacturing lead times have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We place non-
cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to
secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new
product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.",['What was the percentage growth of automotive revenue for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022?']

 customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotivesolutions and systems. Additionally, we continue 
to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significantrevenue
 for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if wefocus
 on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adverselyaffected.
 We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers,partners, and
 ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if wedo
 not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business willbe harmed.
For
 our  products  that  we  do not  sell  directly  to  consumers,  achieving  design wins  is  an  important  success  factor,  including  for  our  interconnectproducts.
 Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate featuresand
 functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins insubsequent
 generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selectionprocesses.

pated, if any.Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our
 target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or serviceofferings,
 industry  standards  continue  to  evolve,  customer  needs  change  and  new  competitors  enter  these  markets.  Our  competitors’  products,services and

or other third-party claim s against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes
available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the
loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP . Howeve r, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be
materially dif ferent from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars
at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.
Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, exce pt for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet
amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated
Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.
Income T axes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax
jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary
differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available
evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferr ed tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgmen ts and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,
changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we
recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign  income tax contingencies based on our estima te of whether , and the extent to which, additional taxes may be
due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to
recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly .
As of January 28, 2024,  we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that
management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent
realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits
of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outsta nding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any",['How is basic net income per share computed?']

License and Development Arrangements
Our license and develo pment arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the
revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services
are performe d. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each
project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.
Software Licensing
Our softwar e licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer . Customers may purchase either
perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are
frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspec ified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software
licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer . Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or
as services are performed.
Cloud Services
Cloud servic es, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided
on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the
contract period. Revenu e related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occu rs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but
certain of ferings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance
obligation. We account for multiple agreements  with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements
indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in ef fect, parts of a single contract.
We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple perfor mance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling
price basis. The standal one selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific produ ct or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances
and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.
If a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.
Product W arranties
We offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware
component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited
circumstances, we may offer an extended limited  warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a
loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,
or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of
grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions , or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs",['How does NVIDIA recognize revenue from their license and development arrangements with customers?']

companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or
other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system
failures or cyber-attacks,  military actions or economic, business, labor , environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party
foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster , war or catastrophic event
affects us, the third-party  systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses,
and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and
operating results.

Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Pursuant to the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“Grant Notice ”) and this Global Restricted Stock Unit
Agreement (including any additional terms and conditions for your count ry set forth in the appendix attached hereto (the
“Appendix ”)) (collectively , the “Agreement ”), NVIDIA  Corporation (the “Company ”) has awarded you a Restricted Stock
Unit Award (the “Award ”) under its Amend ed & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan ”). This Award is granted
to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant ”). Capitalized terms not explicitly
defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.
1.    Grant of the Award. The Award repres ents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common
Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subje ct to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the
Company for your benefit (the “Account ”) the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Excep t as
otherwise provided  in this Agreement, you will not be required to make  any payment to the Company with respect to
your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.
2.    Vesting.  Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance
with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable,
contained in the Grant Notice. Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if termination
is by reason of death, in which case vesting will accelerate as describe d in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other
acceleration provided for in the Gran t Notice or the Plan). On the termina tion of your Continuous Service (for any reason
other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such
termination (and are not accelerated  pursuant to any acceleration provi ded for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be
forfeited and returned to the Compan y at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or
to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous
Service during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting
date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.
3.    Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.
( a )        The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Com mon Stock) subject to your
Award will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.
( b )        Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a
result of a Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on
transferability , and

"serve marke ts worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that
our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,
excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and service s not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,
Latin Americ a, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the
time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase
investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platfo rm companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions
on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese
government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain produ cts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on
our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.
Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regula tors and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks
and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
Shareholder advocacy groups, certain investm ent funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused
increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be
satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further , there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the
U.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’  expectatio ns. Additionally , our corporate sustainability practices, oversight
of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder ,

Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other
actions may adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership
and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business
acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;
employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;
cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,
and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our
employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have
designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our
employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we
are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance
costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators
on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power
in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions,
the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could
have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of
governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions
could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on
the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to
time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated
export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be
subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results
and financial condition.
For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control
measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year","['How could changes to laws, rules, and regulations impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship products?']"

For example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other
defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in
future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have
accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In
general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or
inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our
technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage
may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business
Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.
Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or
trade policy, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses,
including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past
and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:
•increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin
and may continue to do so;
•increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the
future reduce our margins;
•decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;
•the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products
to customers and/or end users;
•limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;
•the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensing parties; reduced profitability may also cause some customers to
scale back operations, exit businesses, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations; lead to mergers, consolidations
or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and
•increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse
impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the
value of our financial instruments.
International operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to us to risks that could harm our business.
We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third
parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 69% of our revenue during fiscal year 2023 from sales outside of the United
States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and

NVIDIA
 pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, wehave
 expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphicsand
 the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, orAI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmente
d and virtual reality, or AR and VR.The
 GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates humanintelligence,
 enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores,are
 essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serveas the brain of
 computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted bythousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that wou
ld have been impossible with traditional coding.NVIDIA
 has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware and systems, software, algorithms and libraries, and services to create unique value forthe
 markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architectureleveragi
ng our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end marketswith
 the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. Thelarge and growing number of develo
pers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.Innovation
 is at our core. We have invested over $29 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essentialto
 modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computergraphics.
 With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU for generalpurpose computing. This approach sign
ificantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such asaerospace,
 bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and networking accelerate many ofthe
 fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are wellsuited
 for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on thepace described by Moore’s Law, we deliv
er GPU performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.Gamers
 choose  NVIDIA  GPUs  to  enjoy  immersive,  increasingly  cinematic  virtual  worlds.  GPUs  also  help  underpin  the  world’s  fastest  growingspectator
 sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number ofgamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning po
pulation of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.Researchers
 use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. Withsupport
 for  more  than  2,500  applications  -  including  the  top  15  HPC  applications  -  NVIDIA  GPUs  enable  some  of  the  most  promising  areas  ofdiscovery,",['How has NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to expand into various computationally intensive fields?']
"Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated future financial results. For example, we have
granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could
impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our
cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. Failure to meet our expectations
or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience
substantial price volatility.
